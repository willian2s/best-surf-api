# Contributing

## Issues

If you found a problem or something that could be improved, the opening of an Issue reporting the case will be welcome in the [bug report](https://github.com/willian2s/forecast-api/issues). Before that, please check that one is not already reporting the same issue.

## Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the repository, here is a quick guide:

  1. Fork the repository
  2. Develop and test your code
     * Your code, at a minimum, must successfully build on Github Actions (When enabled)
  3. Commit your changes:
     * Use clear messages to document your commit
     * Include an Emoji de at the beginning of the pull request message that conforms to the emoji table. See the appropriate [Emojis](#emojis)
  4. Push to your fork and then send a pull request to the **dev** branch

## Emojis

When creating or updating the `pull request` message, please **start** the commit message with the emoji that identifies the pull request. Emojis should not be used in the pull request title. Emojis can also be used in `commits`.
